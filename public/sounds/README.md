# Sound Files for Quiz Game

This directory should contain the following sound files:

1. `success.mp3` - A sound that plays when the user answers correctly
2. `error.mp3` - A sound that plays when the user answers incorrectly

## How to Add Sound Files

You can download free sound effects from websites like:

- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)
- [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

Download the sound files and rename them to `success.mp3` and `error.mp3`, then place them in this directory.

## Sound File Requirements

- Format: MP3
- Duration: Short (1-2 seconds)
- Size: Small (less than 100KB each)

## Fallback Behavior

If the sound files are not found, the application will gracefully handle the error and continue functioning without sound effects.
